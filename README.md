## What Is a Multimode to Singlemode Fiber Converter?

A **multimode to singlemode converter** is a specialized **fiber optic media converter** designed to bridge two different types of fiber‚Äîmultimode (MM) and singlemode (SM). These media converters are essential in expanding legacy networks, enabling long-distance transmission (up to 20km), and improving fiber link compatibility in enterprise, campus, and industrial settings.

**Key Use Case:**  
When connecting two buildings with different fiber infrastructures, such as an older multimode switch to a long-distance singlemode fiber backbone.
